## Question: Search Insert Position

Write a Python program that determines the index at which a given target value should be inserted into a sorted array, such that the order of the array is maintained. If the target is already in the array, return its index.

### Task

Write a Python program that:
- Takes a sorted list of integers `nums` and an integer `target` as input.
- Returns the index if the target is found in the list.
- If the target is not found, returns the index where the target should be inserted to maintain the order of the array.

### Example

Given:
Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The target value 5 is found at index 2.
