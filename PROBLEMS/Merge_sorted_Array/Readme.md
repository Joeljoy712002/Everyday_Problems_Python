# QUESTION:
You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively. Merge `nums2` into `nums1` as one sorted array.



## TASK:
1. Merge the elements of `nums2` into `nums1` such that the resulting array is sorted.
2. Modify `nums1` in-place without using extra space.

## EXAMPLES:

**Example 1:**
```python
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The merged array is [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6].
