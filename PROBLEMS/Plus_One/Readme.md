## Question: Plus One

Write a Python program that increments a large integer represented as an array of digits by one. The most significant digit is at the beginning of the array, and each element in the array contains a single digit. You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zeros, except for the number 0 itself.

### Task

Write a Python program that:
- Takes a list of integers `digits` representing a large integer.
- Returns a list of integers representing the large integer incremented by one.

### Example

Given:
Input: digits = [1, 2, 3]
Output: [1, 2, 4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123. Incrementing by one gives 124.
