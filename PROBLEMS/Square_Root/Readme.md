# QUESTION:
Implement a function that computes the integer square root of a non-negative integer `x`. The integer square root is defined as the largest integer `n` such that `n * n <= x`. You should not use any built-in exponentiation functions or the `sqrt` function.


## EXAMPLES:

**Example 1:**
```python
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 * 2 = 4, which is equal to 4.
