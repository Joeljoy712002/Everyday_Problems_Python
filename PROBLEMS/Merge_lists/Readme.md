# Question: Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists Challenge

Write a Python program that merges two sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

## Task

Write a Python program that:
- Takes two linked lists, `list1` and `list2`, as input. Both linked lists are sorted in ascending order.
- Merges these two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.
- Returns the head of the merged sorted linked list.

### Example
