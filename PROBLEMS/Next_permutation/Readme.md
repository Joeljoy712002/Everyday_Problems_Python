# Question: Next Permutation Challenge

    Write a Python program that finds the next lexicographical permutation of a given string.

### Task

Write a Python pgm that:

    1. Takes a list `s` representing a string as input.
    2. Finds the next lexicographical permutation of the string. If no such permutation exists (i.e., the current permutation is the last one in lexicographical order), return `False`.
    3. Returns `True` if a next permutation exists, otherwise returns `False`.
